# FoodLogiQ C	ode Challenge App based on angular feed
T
The app contains AngularJS libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. 
The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire two controllers and views together. You can
check it out by opening app/index.html in your browser (might not work file `file://` scheme in
certain browsers, see note below).


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.
